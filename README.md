# Housing_Price_Prediction

Team Members: Guoqiang Liang, Bingyi Li, Fang Wang

## Goal

Build a regression model that describes which aspects of a home most strongly affects its value / predicts the value at which the house will be sold.

## Brief Intro

Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won’t begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition’s dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

In this regression case study, we used R and linear regression to analyze the value of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. 
A major component of online companies like [Redfin](https://www.redfin.com) and [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com) is their ability to develop estimates for the cost of a house currently on the market. In this study, we will act like an employee at one of these companies. 



## Description of Data

The dataset we will be analyzing in this study is saved in the housing.txt file, and a description of each variable in the data set is provided in the Data Description.txt file on the github site.


The data contains 1460 observations with 79 variables, including a house ID and the sale price of each house.


## Deliverable

The [report](https://github.com/bingyil/Housing_Price_Prediction/blob/master/Regression_Report.pdf) is a complete demonstration of the discussion and summary of the prediction as well as evaluation.
